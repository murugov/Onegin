And you don't want another mind.  
As long as we share the same smile.  
Break down the barriers before you,  
I don't want to be with someone new,  
I thought I had reached the goal set.  
I'll love you with all of me, somehow,  
It all began in a strange way,  
It started so lyrical and fey,  
Leave all the past far behind.  
Let me be yours for a while.  
Let's leave the absinthe upset,  
Shut up and kiss me now,  
Shut up and kiss me, no fuss.
That moment I'll never forget.  
That spark still flashes between us.  
The moment is not lost yet,
