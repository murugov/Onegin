Shut up and kiss me now,  
Let me be yours for a while.  
I'll love you with all of me, somehow,  
As long as we share the same smile.  

It all began in a strange way,  
That moment I'll never forget.  
It started so lyrical and fey,  
I thought I had reached the goal set.  

Break down the barriers before you,  
Leave all the past far behind.  
I don't want to be with someone new,  
And you don't want another mind.  

The moment is not lost yet,  
That spark still flashes between us.  
Let's leave the absinthe upset,  
Shut up and kiss me, no fuss.
